## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This API web application was created as part of the CODELEX intensive course's C#/.Net.
Its primary purpose was to understand how the ASP.NET Framework works, as well as how to leverage API technologies and develop the project's FrontEnd.
It was created in three major sections, allowing us to examine the whole development process as well as the use of various technologies.
The TDD concept was used to construct it.
I was giving it my all!
